When you are looking for a programmer to hire, especially if it is an individual to be working in your organization, you should try to identify if the person is curious.

But why is it important to be curious in programing?
It is important because programmers must be constantly finding new and better way to structure their solutions to problems.
Programming, and tech in general, is constantly evolving and if this person is not willing to be up-to-date, they will very quickly become obsolete.
Hiring a programmer, in many ways is a lot about personal characteristics as much as professional skills. 
   i.e.: if you had to choose between a candidate that knows the language you were planning to use (but any other language), and a programmer that knows two or three other complex languages (but not yet the one you were planning to use), it might be better to hire the second one and either allow for a different language or teach him the new language.

There  are many ways to do so, some of them are:
 1.Does this person has an opinion about ongoing trends?
  a.If they have an opinion it means that they have the intellectual curiosity to find out what is going on, and how this affects their work
 2. How many programming languages does this person know? Are those complex or simple? Have they learned a new language over the last 12 months?
 3. Give them a "test challenge", and observe how they react to it, and the effort they put in coming up with a creative solution. Try to get a sense if the person is really interested in knowing what would be the application of the SW.
